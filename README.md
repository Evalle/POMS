The main ideas from the ["Principles of Microservices"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920043935.do) course

### Introduction
The Microservices (M) are small, **autonomous** services that work together
*Small* here means that they're doing one thing well. 

The Microservices are just one of the implementations of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Benefits of M:**
 - better allignment with the organization
 - ship faster
 - independent scaling
 - enable segregation models
 - adopt technologies more easily (you can use different languages/technologies for each M.)
